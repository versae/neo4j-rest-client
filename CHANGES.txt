  wrapper class.
- Added Q syntax for more complicated queries.
- Added support for the Q query syntax for indexes using the DSL
  at http://github.com/scholrly/lucene-querybuilder
  by @epurcell3.
- Fixed an error in the test_query_index case (forgot to include an 'or'.
  between queries).
- Added lucene-querybuilder to the test requirements in setup.py.
- Added a test case for Q-based queries.


1.3.4 (2011-06-22)
------------------
- Fixed the setup.py and httplib2 import error during installing.
- Reordered the options variables in an options.py file.
  Allows index.query() to be called with or without a key
- Fixed issue #15 regarding dependency to httplib2
- Patched index.query() so it can take a query without a key (to support, say,
  mutli-field Lucene queries). Ultimately, query so probably be refactored to
  Index (instead of IndexKey) because IndexKey doesn't actually help with
  full-text queries.
- Fixed for issue #19 (missed that urllib.quote).
- Altered the test_query_index case to reflect how I think indexing should
  work.
- Using assertTrue instead of failUnless in tests.py, failUnless is deprecated
  in 2.7 and up, so I figured we might as well switch.
- Added SMART_ERRORS (aka "Django mode"). If you set SMART_ERROR to True it
  will make the client throw KeyError instead of NotFoundError when a key is
  missing.


1.3.3 (2011-06-14)
------------------
- Fixed an introspection when the results list of a traverse is empty.
- Merge pull request #17 from mhluongo/master
- Resolved the STOP_AT_END_OF_GRAPH traversal test case.
  Calling .traverse(stop=STOP_AT_END_OF_GRAPH) will now traverse the graph
  without a max depth (and without 500 errors).
- Added a failing test case for traverse(stop=STOP_AT_END_OF_GRAPH).


1.3.2 (2011-05-30)
------------------
- Added a test for deleting relationships.
